# **Ground Your Leadership in Ethics That Transform**

Welcome to the **SHE IS AI Ethics Training Workshop**, where values become action and intention becomes impact.

---

## **Opening Message**

As we build SHE IS AI into a global movement shaped by integrity, inclusion, and community leadership, we must anchor ourselves in a shared ethical foundation.
This training isn't a formality. **It's the heartbeat** of how we collaborate, educate, represent our mission, and serve the women and communities who place their trust in us.

These sessions will align us on how we show up as leaders, trainers, facilitators, ambassadors, and partners across our global ecosystem.
Together, we'll explore how to honor cultural differences, interrupt bias, create psychologically safe learning spaces, and embody the values that position SHE IS AI as the global gold standard for ethical AI leadership development.
